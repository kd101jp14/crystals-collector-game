## About

For this game, the user is given a random "magical" number. There are four crystals with hidden values. The user may click on the crystals to find out their values. Each click on a crystal adds its value to the user's score. The goal is to add the values to match the random "magical" number. If the user matches the score to the random number perfectly, the game is won. If the user's score exceeds the magic number, the game is lost. This game contains audio.
